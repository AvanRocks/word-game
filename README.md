# Word Game
Program that solves a little word game I encountered in my TOK textbook.

The game works as follows. Pick a word, let's say you pick "ship". Pick another word, say "dock". Now you starting with "ship" you can write down other words that differ only in 1 letter and are of the same length as the previous word. You want to create a chain of words that brings you to "dock".
